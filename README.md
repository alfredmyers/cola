# Cola - A collection of cheat sheets

These are by no means an exaustive list on each subject.

Files mostly contain items that I hadn't yet memorized at the time of writing, so if something is missing, it's either because I didn't know about it or because I already memorized it.

File|Description

[command-line](command-line.md)|(Mostly) equivalent commands in Bash, cmd and PowerShell
[gnome](gnome.md)|Key bindings for Gnome
